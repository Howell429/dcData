[![R build
status](https://github.com/mdbeckman/dcData/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mdbeckman/dcData/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

The `dcData` package includes data sets that accompany *Data Computing
(2nd edition)* by Kaplan & Beckman
[(eBook)](https://dtkaplan.github.io/DataComputingEbook/) used to teach
wrangling and visualization techniques that turn data into information.

## Installation

The development version of `dcData` can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("mdbeckman/dcData")
```

<!-- You can install the released version of dcData from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- install.packages("dcData") -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- # install.packages("devtools") -->

<!-- devtools::install_github("mdbeckman/dcData") -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->

<!-- library(dcData) -->

<!-- ## basic example code -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->

<!-- summary(cars) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->
