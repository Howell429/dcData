\description{
The United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network
releases a report giving several indices of "happiness" measured for each of
more than 150 countries. These data are from the 2013 report
(<http://unsdsn.org/resources/publications/world-happiness-report-2013/>).
Underlying the data are the results of Gallop World Polls â€” the country data
is presumably the aggregate of data from individual people, although how the
aggregate is made is uncertain to this writer.

\details{
The healthy life expectancy (HALE) is a World Health Organization
measure of how long, on average, a person can be expected to live in good
health.

The data were scraped from a PDF file released by the United Nations. A few
country names were changed to match those in `CountryData` (e.g., Myanmar ->
Burma). Not all of the `HappinessIndex` countries are in `CountryData`, and vice
versa.
